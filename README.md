# Godot Minigame 1

## Devlog

My analogy is that a full Godot project can be described as a shopping mall, with the scenes being the shops and the nodes being the products sold in the shops. The products being sold can have different characteristics that change how the items function, just like how nodes can contain different variables that change what objects in the game can do. Scenes and nodes depend on each other; scenes contain multiple nodes and without them, the scene cannot function, which is similar to how stores cannot function without their products. In addition, if a node does not have a scene, then it would not know when to start working, like how a product is not able to serve its purpose without a store to sell it.
